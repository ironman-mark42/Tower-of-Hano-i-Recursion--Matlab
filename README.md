Given a positive integer n, list all the moves required in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle to move n disks from one peg to another according to the rules of the puzzle.

### Project implementation

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle uses three pegs.
Each peg is is a an object that implements a stack data structure.
The stack is implemented using nodes.
Each node contains a value and the next node.
